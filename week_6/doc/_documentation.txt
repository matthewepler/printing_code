<!-- DIR -->
* /itp_logo_poster :: code for layout of poster and placement of image files 
generated by "itp_logo_system" sketch.
* doc/modular_grid_no_overlap :: code written by Rune Madsen used in
"itp_logo_poster" sketch.
* /itp_logo_system/softlab.tif :: see NOTES section.

<!-- NOTES -->
An alternative version of this exists using only the initial cube design
that is seen as the default shape when you run this sketch. I thought the
colorful nature of the "swirls" were more appealing to the eye, but realize
that they create problems with printing, readability, etc. As a result, I
hope to build a more functional version of this system with the cube that
will allow for the faces of the cube to be used as content areas such as
upcoming events, updates, event info, etc. This version would live primarily
on the web.

The original cube design can be seen in the file "softlab.tif" located in
the "itp_logo_system" folder.
